### Hi there 👋

Hey, I'm [Keenan](https://www.keenanjohnson.com/)! 

I have built some of the world’s most ambitious engineering projects and gained expertise in understanding people, teams, and technology to achieve the impossible for the good of all.

I am building a software development studio that builds software for hardware. Check out our products, including [Souffle](https://www.souffle.today/) and [Pandoro](https://github.com/breadboardfoundry/pandoro).

I am also building the [Ribbit Network](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network) 🐸 (a 501c3 non-profit) to empower anyone to join in the work on climate and provide informed data for climate action through the power of open-source hardware and software.
