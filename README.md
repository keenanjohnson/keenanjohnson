### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Keenan](https://www.keenanjohnson.com/)! Reach out if I can help you or if you just want to chat.

### Current Projects
- I'm building a large network of [open-source, low-cost, CO2 Gas Detection Sensors](https://github.com/keenanjohnson/ghg-gas-cloud). These sensor units will enable many to contribute to the work on climate by contributing to the world's largest greenhouse gas database.

### Past Work Highlights: 
- Led an electric aircraft engineering team that delivered the worldâ€™s longest flying, fully electric UAV to prove it was possible to create useful zero-emissions aircraft
- Heavily involved in policy efforts related to Aerospace, Innovation, and Technology
- Mentors companies involved in climate change and aerospace through Techstars and CleanTech Open
- Thrived in the high-pressure mission control of SpaceX
- Built a solar-powered house that teaches about energy usage through a playful, multi-sensory experience.
- Built an Alexa, voice-controlled, Lego robot that can turn and read the pages of books for the visually impaired.
